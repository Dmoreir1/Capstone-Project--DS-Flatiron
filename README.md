## Introduction


Electric Vehicles or 'EV's are the future of transportation. In addition to a mindset of environmental sustainability, state governments are offering incentives for people who are purchasing/registering electric cars in hopes of promoting this shift from reliance on fossil fuels. 
Unlike traditional gas cars, these vehicles rely on battery power and need to be charged in order to operate. 
With more and more electric vehicles on the road, an opportunity for investment presents itself as there is an increasing demand for charging stations. But which states would be best to invest in?

Using data gathered from the past 10 years from 16 states (CA, NY, NJ, CT, TX, FL, MT, MN, MI, WA, OR, VT, VA, TN CO, WI) that have been actively updating their records for registered EV's, I have created a model for each state to forecast the amount of registered vehicles on the road which could be used to determine which states are best to invest in for building charging stations.
